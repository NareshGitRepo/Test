                        This view has been created using data collected each fall through the Michigan Student Data System (MSDS). This view includes students with zero Full-Time Equivalency (FTE) in all grades.
                        
                        To look up audited FTE by district, please go to the MSDS audit forms and choose the school year and district you'd like to view.
                        
                        Graduation and Dropout Rates
                        Student progress toward graduation is tracked from the first report that a student has enrolled in grade nine or higher. At this point a student’s expected graduation date is determined. Enrollment transfer is tracked when the student moves from school to school. A rate is determined for each school for on-time graduation in four years. Five and six year rates are also reported for each school and district.
